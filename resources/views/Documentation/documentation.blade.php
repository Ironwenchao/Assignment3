    <h2>Project Description in brief</h2>
    
    <p>I have completed the majority of the requirements of Assignment 2.</p><br> 
    <p><strong>Including: ERD, database, CRUD, and item review pages etc</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>
        Firstly, I drew the ER diagram and make the relationship among different tables. Then, I created the database base on the ER diagram. Next, I created the controller, model, and the view page. There were many errors when I was doing this assignment but I tried to overcome them via watching lecture videos and search errors on the google. At the end of this assignment, I learned a lot of skills of the web programming and I think it is very useful in the future for me.
